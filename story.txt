Jaosn, a computer science student. Now he had met some challenge about learning
cs 354. But he is ambitious and he'll keep work hard to conquer it.
In daily life, he loves watching films, listening to hip hop and running.

Jaosn woke up one day to the sound of a weird alarm that was different than 
what he was used to hearing. He slowly got out of bed and went through his 
daily routine, only to see that something mysterious was outside his window.

He saw the glimpse of an owl flying away, and saw an envelope on the floor near 
the window. What could it be?

"Huh, probably just a prank," Jaosn thought. "I'm already at my second year in 
Hogwarts." But something caused him to pause and reconsider. He walked over and
picked up the envelope. Suddenly, his face brightened.

There it was, on the envelope, in gilded letters: A POLYNOMIAL TIME ALGORITHM 
FOR THE SUBSET SUM PROBLEM






Recently he is working on some research, it is really interesting but 
challenging. But Jason won't say stop even if there are kinds of
troubls happening all this time. He won't forget his dream and goal until he
achieves what he wants. So please say "fighting!" to Jason.


Jason stumbled down the corridor to get to his first class at Hogwart. 
He didn't want to be late for Prof M's transfiguration class again. 
If he was late one more time, she would suspend his transfiguration
research project. He patted all of his pockets to make sure his want was there (it
was), and continued on to class. Today was going to be a good day.
