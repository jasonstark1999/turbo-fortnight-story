Jaosn, a computer science student. Now he had met some challenge about learning
cs 354. But he is ambitious and he'll keep work hard to conquer it.
In daily life, he loves watching films, listening to hip hop and running.









Recently he is working on some research, it is really interesting but 
challenging. But Jason won't say stop even if there are kinds of
troubls happening all this time. He won't forget his dream and goal until he
achieves what he wants. So please say "fighting!" to Jason.
