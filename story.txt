Jaosn, a computer science student. Now he had met some challenge about learning
cs 354. But he is ambitious and he'll keep work hard to conquer it.
In daily life, he loves watching films, listening to hip hop and running.

Jaosn woke up one day to the sound of a weird alarm that was different than 
what he was used to hearing. He slowly got out of bed and went through his 
daily routine, only to see that something mysterious was outside his window.








Recently he is working on some research, it is really interesting but 
challenging. But Jason won't say stop even if there are kinds of
troubls happening all this time. He won't forget his dream and goal until he
achieves what he wants. So please say "fighting!" to Jason.
